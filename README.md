# autosales
Creating thgis project for learning MongoDb database .
The idea is to simply implement a automobiles api using MEN(Mongo,Node,Express) stack .
Here user can add details about the vehicle and also the sales related data about a particular vehicle.
Tried to create some custom validation for mobile number usig custom validator(mongoose custom validations) and regex express.
